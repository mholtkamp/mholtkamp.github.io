## Comments

Spirit Smash was created for an assignment in Programming I at FIEA. The game uses a Vakz, a game engine that I had previously made before attending FIEA. Although Vakz is a cross-platform engine, Spirit Smash was developed strictly for Windows, and was not tested on Android.

Some of the engine features that are used in Spirit Smash include:
* Animated Mesh rendering
* Point Lights
* Diffuse Materials
* Toon Materials
* XInput Controllers 
* Particle Systems

I will be porting Spirit Smash to the Xbox One in the near future, as part of another FIEA assignment, and in the ported version I would like to add  
* More art assets, such as a background elements and environment lighting.
* Special powerups
* Background music

But of course, these features come after porting Vakz to DirectX 11, which will be necessary for porting the game to Xbox One...
