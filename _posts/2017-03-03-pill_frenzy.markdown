## Comments

Pill Frenzy was a submission to the 2015 November Epic Game Jam, which required our game to fit the theme "Desperate Diseases Require Dangerous Remedies". This was the first game jam I had ever participated in, and I did so alongside my friend and fellow engineer Dustin LaMontagne. This was our first project using Unreal Engine (we had only done some tutorials before this point) so this was a major learning experience for us.

Being our first game jam, we made the mistake of realizing the very first game concept that we could think of. We thought it was inventive and fitting, but there were probably 20 other blood-stream shooters that were submitted. We weren't really upset with this, because we were proud of what we were able to accomplish in only three days with our limited unreal experience.

Dustin and I discovered the beauty of Unreal's post processing and really overkilled the emissive materials, but it was actually somewhat appropriate because it added to the chaotic visual noise that is present in most bullet hell games.
